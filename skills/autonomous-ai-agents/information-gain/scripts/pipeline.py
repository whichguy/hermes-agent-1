"""pipeline.py — the model-calling stages of the information-gain skill.

Stages (each a role-specialized Ollama model, mostly via direct /api/chat raw
calls run in parallel):

    0. frame_and_plan   — restate goal/decision/success + a baseline plan (plan*_0)
    1. generate_questions — interrogate the problem into candidate questions
    2. project_answers  — plausible answers + probabilities + derivability  (parallel)
    3. judge_plan_change — per-answer Δplan and stakes vs the baseline plan  (parallel)

The pure scoring/ranking/selection math is in voi.py; this module only produces
the raw signals (answers, probabilities, Δplan, stakes) for it to score.

Reuse: `build_prompt`, `resolve_alias`, `NON_ENGLISH_MODELS` come from the `ask`
skill's model_utils (resolved at runtime via HERMES_HOME / ASK_SCRIPTS_DIR). The
raw /api/chat call mirrors ask.py::dispatch_single_raw but is owned here so the
many small scoring calls parallelize without the agent-loop / reasoning-effort race.
