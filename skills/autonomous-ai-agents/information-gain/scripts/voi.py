"""voi.py — pure value-of-information scoring, gating, ranking, and diversity.

No I/O, no network, no model calls. Every function here is deterministic and
unit-testable in isolation. The model-calling stages live in pipeline.py and the
orchestration loop in infogain.py.

Scoring is grounded in the decision-theoretic Expected Value of Sample Information
(EVSI) and expected-information-gain literature (see references/methodology.md):

    EVSI(q) ≈ Σ_a  P(a) · Δplan(a) · stakes(a)        # expected regret avoided
    U       = normalized_entropy(P(a)) · (1 - derivable_prob)   # reducible/epistemic
    value(q) = sqrt( U · EVSI )                        # gate-preserving, [0,1]

`value` is 0 if EITHER the uncertainty gate U or the EVSI is 0 — encoding Howard's
"information has value only if it could change the optimal decision" plus the
necessary conditions (must be uncertain, must be reducible). The geometric mean
keeps `value` on an interpretable ~0..1 scale (so absolute thresholds like 0.40
are meaningful) while preserving the necessary-condition gate.
