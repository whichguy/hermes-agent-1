# Roadmap — validate EVSI, then build the iterative context-builder

Driven by the benchmark (`benchmark-findings.md`). Sequence is deliberate: **get the rating right
before wrapping a loop around it.** Done first (cleanup): removed `answerability` (inert);
benchmark + conclusions saved.

## Phase 1 — Validate (and if needed, fix) EVSI

**Question:** does a high `value` actually predict a question whose answer improves the response?
The benchmark showed internal `value` and external quality can diverge (usaw: value 0.69, relevance
0.20). The EVSI *structure* is sound; the suspect links are input estimates, threshold scale, and
unproven validity.

**1.1 Use-relevant validity study (the core test).** For N prompts, produce three responses and
judge them blind for relevance to the prompt:
- `baseline` — respond with no clarification.
- `top2` — answer the **top-2** ranked questions, fold the answers in (evidence loop), then respond.
- `low2` — answer 2 **low-ranked / random** questions, fold in, then respond.
Pass condition: `top2 > low2 ≥ baseline`. If answering top-ranked questions doesn't beat answering
low-ranked ones, the rating isn't earning its place and we recalibrate/re-elicit. This study also
*builds the answerer + response-generator that Phase 2 needs* — so it de-risks the wrapper directly.
**It also yields `diminishing_floor` from evidence:** answer questions across the whole `value`
spectrum (not just top-2 vs low-2) and plot **realized improvement vs question `value`** — the floor is
where improvement flattens to ~0. Set the cap from the curve, don't guess it.

**1.2 Post-hoc formula ablations (near-free).** We already store per-question components (U, P, Δ,
stakes). Re-derive rankings under alternatives — EVSI-only (drop U), max-Δ vs P-weighted mean — and
see which best matches "which questions actually improved the response" from 1.1. No new model calls.

**1.3 Calibration → rank-relative (likely).** Absolute thresholds (0.40/0.60) are model-dependent
(fast → everything PRE_ANSWER; deepseek → fewer). Switch selection to rank/relative (top-K, or
≥ X% of the round's best). Small change, robust to model scale.

**1.4 Elicitation (only if 1.1 says inputs are the weak link).** Replace absolute 0–1 Δ/stakes with
**comparative/pairwise** judgments ("which answer would change the response more?") — models are far
better at comparisons than at calibrated absolute numbers. Bigger effort; gated on evidence.

**Exit:** an EVSI we've shown predicts realized improvement (or a recalibrated one that does).

## Phase 2 — The iterative context-builder ("iterate context")

A wrapper/orchestrator around the (validated) info-gain primitive that builds up context to
convergence and then responds. Keeps info-gain report-only; the wrapper does the answering + looping
+ responding (primitive-vs-orchestrator discipline).

**Why one continuously-growing context (the core principle).** Every round, the LLM conditions on the
*entire* accumulated context — prompt + all prior questions + every tombstone (answered facts *and*
known gaps). As tombstones accrue, the model's implicit posterior over the problem sharpens, so each
new round's questions, answer-projections, research, and the final response are all conditioned on
everything established so far. The single growing context **is** the substrate on which the LLM's
Bayesian updating operates continuously — which is exactly why we **always append** (never fragment or
reset the context) and why the tombstones must be **clean, high-signal facts**. That is the whole point
of the `ask`-isolation: the noisy research reasoning stays out of the loop; only the distilled fact
enters the context the model continuously reasons over.

**Loop:**
```
tombstones = []          # each: {question, status: ANSWERED | NOT_FOUND, answer?, ctx_version}
ctx_version = 0
for round in range(max_rounds):
    evidence = facts(tombstones)                               # answered facts + known-gaps — ONE shared context
    ranked = infogain.run(prompt, evidence=evidence)           # rank, given everything known so far
    top = [q for q in ranked.bucket if eligible(q, tombstones, ctx_version)][:K]
    if not top or top[0].value < diminishing_floor: break      # diminishing returns -> stop
    for q in top:
        res = ask_research(q, prompt, evidence)                # `ask` skill: isolated ctx, returns a distilled fact
        if res.found:
            tombstones += [(q, ANSWERED, res.answer, ctx_version)]; ctx_version += 1   # context grew
        else:
            tombstones += [(q, NOT_FOUND, ctx_version)]        # record the gap; don't re-research at this version
final = ask_respond(prompt, evidence)                          # best response, using the enriched context
return { final, tombstones }
```

**Components:**
- **ANSWERER = the `ask` skill (decided) — used to stay cheap and NOT pollute context.** Each research
  call is `ask` / `model_utils.dispatch_single`: a full Hermes agent in its OWN isolated context with
  **ALL tools available** (file, web, terminal, …) — the research agent is unconstrained in *how* it
  finds the answer. The heavy research reasoning stays in that subprocess; **only the distilled answer**
  (or `NOT_FOUND: <brief reason>`) returns and gets tombstoned. So the main iterate-context holds just
  the prompt + clean tombstones — lean, never bloated with research transcripts. Ask for a *concise*
  answer to keep the returned fact tight.
- **RESPONDER** — final step: "given the prompt + all established facts + known gaps, produce the best
  response." (A `dispatch_single` or strong Ollama call over the enriched context.)
- **CONVERGENCE + cap diagnostics** — stop when the round's top `value` < `diminishing_floor` or no
  eligible questions remain (**natural convergence**), OR when `K` / `max_rounds` is hit (**artificial
  cap**). Always record a **`stop_reason`** and flag **whether an artificial cap bound the run before
  it naturally ran dry** — i.e. `max_rounds` hit while top value ≥ floor, or rounds where *more than K*
  high-value questions were available (K rate-limited us). This is what tells us if the caps are cutting
  off real value vs. the loop genuinely converging.

**Tombstone state machine (the refinement):**
- **ANSWERED** (`Q → A`): a discovered fact. Enters the context; the evidence mechanism makes the
  question derivable so it drops out of future rounds.
- **NOT_FOUND** (`Q → not discoverable at this context state`): *informative, not a failure* — a known
  gap that shapes both the final response and the next questions. Two rules:
  - **Don't re-research it at the same `ctx_version`** (no wasted budget).
  - **Revive it when the context grows.** Every ANSWERED tombstone bumps `ctx_version`; a NOT_FOUND
    question attempted at an older version becomes **eligible again**, because a newly-discovered fact
    may open a path to it ("if we discover another path, the question could be answered"). `eligible()`
    enforces both rules. *(Likely a small addition to info-gain: pass NOT_FOUND questions as a
    "known gaps" list so generation neither re-asks them nor treats them as resolved.)*

**Where it lives:** `scripts/iterate.py` in this skill (composes `infogain.run` + `dispatch_single`
research + responder); promote to its own `clarify-and-respond` skill if it grows. Info-gain stays
report-only.

**Cost reality (grounded changes this a lot).** The scoring is cheap Ollama (~14 calls/round, ~30s),
but each grounded answer is a **full agent-loop research call (~30–60s + web)**. K=2 × ~3 rounds = ~6
research calls ≈ 3–6 min/run, dominating cost. Implications to decide: cap rounds tightly, cache
researched facts, and make the diminishing-returns floor *aggressive* so we don't pay to research
low-value questions.

**Decided:** answerer = `ask` (isolated context, distilled answer), **all tools available** to the
research agent · NOT_FOUND recorded as a tombstone + revivable when context grows · context is the
single continuously-growing shared state · **K = 6** (a cap for now) · everything **configurable** ·
the loop **reports `stop_reason` and flags when an artificial cap (K / max_rounds) bound it before
natural convergence**.
**Determined by evidence, not guessed:** `diminishing_floor` — Phase 1 measures where answering stops
improving the response (the improvement-vs-`value` curve); the floor is set from that, not assumed.
**Still to set:** research model · `max_rounds` cap · final deliverable (response, or response +
tombstone trail).
